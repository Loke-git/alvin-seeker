This is a simple webscraper targeting Alvin pages. It can interact with Alvin's OAI-PMH protocol, scrape individual URLs given in a list, or in full CHEF mode hunt down and scrape every child (subordinate) post of a given collection post.

To use, run alvin-chef.py. Requires re, requests and bs4. Follow the prompts.

If using OAI or URL mode, feed the script a list of IDs separated by a comma (00000,111111,22222) if you have more than 1.
